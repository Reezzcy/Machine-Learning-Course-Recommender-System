# Machine-Learning-Course-Recommender-System
IBM Machine Learning Capstone

## Project Description

In this project, we will conduct exploratory data analysis to understand online course data patterns, BoW feature extraction from course titles and descriptions, cosine similarity measurement to determine the similarity between courses, as well as build three course recommendation systems using different methods, including user profile-based systems, course similarity, and clustering. In addition, we will use collaborative filtration techniques to make predictions about user interests based on other users' similar preferences, and use neural networks to predict course ratings by utilizing user and item latent features and regression or classification techniques. By combining these various methods and techniques, we aim to develop an effective and accurate course recommendation system to improve the online learning experience.
